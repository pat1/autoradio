Here's how to proceed
  * Make sure you have installed the latest Flash plugin (ver. 10 or later)
  * Download and unpack the [http://anoggplayer.googlecode.com/files/AnOggV2_test%20suite.7z TestSuite] to a new local directory(you may need to install [http://www.7-zip.org 7zip])
  * Go to Adobe's [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html security manager]
  * Add the directory with test suite files to trusted files list
  * Open the !TestPlayer.html in your web browser (Firefox and IE were tested to work)

You can change the !TestPlayer.html to load any web stream or local ogg file. Only files at 128 Kbps or less will work properly.
Click the volume button to turn the player on or off. Press and drag the button to increase/decrease volume.

## Check a file's timestamp. In this example, we test if a file is older                            
## than 3 minutes and assume something is wrong if its not updated.

  check  file autoradiotimestamp with path /tmp/autoradio.timestamp
    if timestamp > 3 minutes then restart

  check process autoradiod with pidfile /tmp/autoradio.lock
    start program = "/usr/local/bin/autoradiod restart"
    stop program  = "/usr/local/bin/autoradiod stop"
    depends on autoradiotimestamp
